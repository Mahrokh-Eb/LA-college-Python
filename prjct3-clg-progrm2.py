Description: Student average score  50 pts
Professor Navarro is trying to find the average score for 5 exams. She wants to drop the lowest and highest scores from the list before finding the average.

Below is the list of  her students with 5 scores for 5 exams :

studentName   ex1 ex2 ex3 ex4 ex5
===================================
Jones Tom      94  99  96 74  56
Thompson Frank 67 58  86  95  47
Jackson Tom    95 97  94  87  67
Jackie Michael 43 23  34  77  64
Johnson Sara   84 93  64  57  89
Colt McCoy     84 93  64  57  70
Freeman Tina   67 58 86  95  47
First, we will ask the user to enter student name and  scores for 5 exams. Store these information into a two dimensional list (matrix)
Your program should include the following functions:

  getStudentInfo() should ask the user for student info including student name and 5 scores, before storing each of these scores into the list, make sure to validate it by calling another function ValidateUserInput(score). The function getStudentInfo() should be called from the main program.
findLowest(scores) should find and return the lowest of the 5 scores passed to it. NOTE: You are not allowed to use min() function
findHighest(scores) should find and return the highest of the 5 scores passed to it. NOTE: You are not allowed to use max() function
    â€¢ calcScore(scores) should calculate and return the average of the 3 scores that
       remain after dropping the highest and lowest scores the student received. This
       function should be called just once by main and should be passed the scores.

Two additional functions, described above findHighest() and findLowest(), should be called by calcScore, which uses the returned information to determine which of the scores to drop.
